                <p>Hello, I am Anna and I have been an avid crime drama viewer for as long as I can remember. I watch any and all crime dramas I can find. This includes Bones, NCIS, CSI, Blue Bloods, and Criminal Minds. I was curious how ratings changed over the past decade for even the most popular shows and made this dataset using the ratings of the first and last season of the Law & Order shows. There are technically seven Law & Order shows, however I excluded the Trial by Jury, Los Angeles, and True Crime spin-offs since they did not run for more than one season.</p>
                <h2>First, what are ratings are how are they calculated?</h2>
                <p>Nielsen ratings are the standard for TV viewership measurement. They have been providing metrics since 1950. According to Nielsen, rating shows the percent of households or people that tuned to a program during a given period of time. Specifically, these ratings tell media participants who was exposed to content and advertising. This is how value and, therefore, pricing is set for advertisers purchasing TV ad spots. Let's see how Law & Order's viewership has changed among series and seasons.</p>

                <h2>Findings and Possible Rationale</h2>
                <p>Overall, all series ratings declined. Only SVU and Organized Crime are currently airing. For adults 18-49, Organized Crime and SVU ranked 13th and 14th most watched show in the 2020-2021 season despite having ratings which fall among the original and Criminal Intent, both canceled due to falling ratings.</p>
                <p>SVU fans such as myself wonder if SVU has passed its prime. Surpassing Gunsmoke, SVU is the longest-running primetime U.S. live-action series and the only live-action primetime series debuting in the 1990s to release new episodes. Elliot Stabler, originally a character from SVU, is featured in Organized Crime. Some wonder if loyal SVU fans may be bolstering viewership.</p>
