                        <h2>Box Office Numbers</h2>
                        <p>This dataset has every single Disney movie (until 2016) with release dates, genre, rating, total gross and inflation adjusted gross (2016). In this visualization, the genre and gross for movies are measured and represented. In addition, I included the gross revenue adjusted for inflation to see if there is a noticeable impact on theatre revenue over the past decade especially. Find the dataset on Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/prateekmaj21/disney-movies" target="_blank"> here.</a></p>
                        <p><b>In the past decade, streaming over the internet has been an exponentially growing way to consume television and movie consumption.</b> I was curious about how this would impact box office numbers as people could access the same movies on their devices the same day it hit theatres.</p>
                        <p>In terms of Disney movies, Adventure and Action movies are the top grossing films from the mid-1990s to 2016. From the 1980s to the mid-1990s, comedy movies was the top grossing genre.</p>
                        <p>I did some external research and found box office numbers for movies. There was not a significant drop in box until 2020. This is due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, the box office amount was $11,255,475,286 (adjusted) and fell below $10,000,000,000 for the first time in at least 25 years to $2,044,876,261 in 2020. In 2021, the total was $4,035,294,267.</p>
